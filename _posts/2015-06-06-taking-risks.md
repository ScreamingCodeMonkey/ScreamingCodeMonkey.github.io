Taking Risks

Recently a piece of work that I was involved in was entered into a number
of award shows both national and internationally. Now in my own biased 
opinion the work was amazing. The directors, the creative and media
strategy that went out were all done to great standards. However being
part of the technical team the project was a logistical nightmare. The
job was risky. I still find it hard to understand just how the pros and
cons out weigh each other. So I've decided to jot down the risks that we
took in a last attempt to envision the fine line we balanced between
award winning digital and crashing and burning.
